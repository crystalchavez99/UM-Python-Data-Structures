# Python Data Structures

## 9.1 Dictionaries

### A Story of Two Collections

* `List`: linear collections of values that stay in order
* `Dictionary`: bag of values, each with its own label

### Dictionaries

* Dictionaries are Python's powerful data collection
* A `dictionary` is like a list, but more general. In a list, the index positions have to be integers; in a dictionary, the indices can be (almost) any type.
  * has no order
  * index the things we put in dictionary than numbers, basically lookup tag

### Compare List and Dict
* Dicts are like lists except they use keys instead of numbers to lookup values

### Dictionary Literals
* You can think of a dictionary as a mapping between a set of indices (which are called `keys`) and a set of `values`. Each `key` maps to a `value`. The association of a key and a value is called a `key-value pair` or sometimes an item.

* `dict()` creates a new dictionary with no items
```python
>>> eng2sp = dict()
>>> print(eng2sp)
{}
```
* The curly brackets, `{}`, represent an empty dictionary.
* To add items to dictionary, simply use square brackets
```python
>>> eng2sp['one'] = 'uno'
```
* This line creates an item that maps from the key 'one' to the value “uno”.
```python
>>> print(eng2sp)
{'one': 'uno'}
```
* you use the keys to look up the corresponding values:
* if the key isn't in dictionary you get `KeyError`
