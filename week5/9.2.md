## 9.2 Counting Dictionaries

### Many counters w/ dictionary

* Common use of dictionaries is counting how often we see something
* There are several implementations, a way of performing a computation.
* Example:
```python
word = 'brontosaurus'
d = dict()
for c in word:
    if c not in d:
        d[c] = 1
    else:
        d[c] = d[c] + 1
print(d)
```
* effectively computing a `histogram`, which is a statistical term for a set of counters (or frequencies).
* The for loop traverses the string. Each time through the loop, if the character c is not in the dictionary, we create a new item with key c and the initial value 1 (since we have seen this letter once). If c is already in the dictionary we increment d[c].

Hereâ€™s the output of the program:

```python
{'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'o': 2, 'n': 1, 's': 2, 'r': 2, 'u': 2, 't': 1}
```

### Get Method

* `get()` that takes a key and a default value. If the key appears in the dictionary, get returns the corresponding value; otherwise it returns the default value.
```python
word = 'brontosaurus'
d = dict()
for c in word:
    d[c] = d.get(c,0) + 1
print(d)
```
