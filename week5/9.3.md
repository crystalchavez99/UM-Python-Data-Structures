# Python Data Structures

## 9.3 Files and Dictionaries

* One of the common uses of a dictionary is to count the occurrence of words in a file with some written text

### Counting Pattern

* general pattern to count words in a line of text is to split line into words, loop through words and use dictionary to track count of each word
* You will see that we have two `for` loops. The `outer loop `is reading the lines of the file and the `inner loop` is iterating through each of the words on that particular line. This is an example of a pattern called `nested loops` because one of the loops is the outer loop and the other loop is the inner loop.
```python
fname = input('Enter the file name: ')
try:
    fhand = open(fname)
except:
    print('File cannot be opened:', fname)
    exit()

counts = dict()
for line in fhand:
    words = line.split()
    for word in words:
        if word not in counts:
            counts[word] = 1
        else:
            counts[word] += 1

print(counts)
```

### Loops and dictionaries

* We can write a `for` loop that goes through all the entries in a dictionary
  * goes through all keys in dictionary and looks up values
```python
counts = { 'chuck' : 1 , 'annie' : 42, 'jan': 100}
for key in counts:
    print(key, counts[key])
# jan 100
# chuck 1
# annie 42
```

### Retrieve list of keys and values

* `list.keys()` get list of keys
* `list.values()` get list of values
* `list.items()` get list of key-value pairs
