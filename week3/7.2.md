# Python Data Structures

## 7.1 Files More

### File Handle as a Sequence

* File handle opens the ability to read, which can be treated as a sequence of strings since each line in the file is a string in sequence
* use for statement to iterate
```python
xfile = open('mbox.txt')
for cheese in xfile:
    print(cheese)
```

### Count Lines in File

1. Open a file read-only
2. Use for loop to read each line
3. Count lines and print out number of lines
```python
fhand = open('file.txt')
count = 0
for line in fhand:
    count += 1
print('Line Count:', count)
```

### Read File

* can read the whole file into a single string using `<file>.read()`

### Search through file

* When you are searching through data in a file, it is a very common pattern to read through a file, ignoring most of the lines and only processing lines which meet a particular condition.
* Can put an `if` statement in our `for` loop to print certain lines or all lines
```python
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
count = 0
for line in fhand:
    if line.startswith('From:'):
        print(line)
```
* Some files may have blank lines printed because of `newline` added at the end
  * which a print statement adds a newline to each line
* Can strip the whitespace from the end using `rstrip()`

### Skip w/ Continue

* Can skip a line using the continue statement
```python
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in fhand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    # Skip 'uninteresting lines'
    if not line.startswith('From:'):
        continue
    # Process our 'interesting' line
    print(line)
```

### Letting the user choose the file name

* It would be more usable to ask the user to enter the file name string each time the program runs so they can use our program on different files without changing the Python code.

* This is quite simple to do by reading the file name from the user using input as follows:
```python
fname = input('Enter the file name: ')
fhand = open(fname)
count = 0
for line in fhand:
    if line.startswith('Subject:'):
        count = count + 1
print('There were', count, 'subject lines in', fname)
```
