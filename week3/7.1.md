# Python Data Structures

## 7.1 Files

### File Processing

* Text file is thought as a sequence of lines

### Opening a File

* Before we read or write a file, we must tell Pythonto open the file
  * Opening the file communicatges with our system to see which file data is stored
* We use `open(file name)` function
  * returns a file handle, a variable used to perform ops on the file
  * You are given a handle if the requested file exists and you have the proper permissions to read the file.
  * If the file does not exist, open will fail with a traceback and you will not get a handle to access the contents of the file
```python
>>> fhand = open('mbox.txt')
>>> print(fhand)
<_io.TextIOWrapper name='mbox.txt' mode='r' encoding='cp1252'>

>>> fhand = open('stuff.txt')
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'stuff.txt'
```

### Using open()

* handle = open(filename,mode)
  * returns a handle use to manipulate file
    * filename is a string
    * mode is optional, `r` if we are reading, `w` if we are going to write

### Newline Character

* Use a special character called `newline` to indicate when line ends
  * used `\n` in strings
```python
stuff = "Hello\nWorld!"
# Hello
# World!
```
