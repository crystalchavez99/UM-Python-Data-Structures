## 10.1 Tuples

### Tuples Like List

* A `tuple` is a sequence of values much like a list.
* Values stored can by any type and indexed by integers, difference is that they are immutable
* are also comparable and hashable, so can sort lists of them and use tuples as key values in Python dictionaries
* a `tuple` is a comma-separated list of values:
```python
>>> t = 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'
```
* To create a tuple with a single element, you have to include the final comma:
  * without it, treats it as a string
```python
>>> t1 = ('a',)
>>> type(t1)
<type 'tuple'>
```
* can construct tuple w/ built in `tuple()`
* Most list operators also work on tuples.
  * You canâ€™t modify the elements of a tuple, but you can replace one tuple with another:
